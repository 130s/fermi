MoveIt Cartesian Path-Planner Configured Robots
=====

The RViz enviroment is preconfigured for the MoveIt Cartesian Planner Plug-in. This configuration allows you to use a blending tool as an end-effector. Furthermore, a virtual wall is placed in the RViz scene to simulate a surface where robot can perform certain action, example blending.

All the necessary visuals are loaded once you launch the Robot Model with the following command:

```
$roslaunch fermi_blending_cell_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch
```
